Final Project

Monkey Riding Bike Wooden Toy 3D

Monkey Riding Bike is a mechanism that represents a toy. As it's said in the name, the mechanism is a monkey riding a bike. I chose this project because it seemed simple and fun to make on my own.

To design and render the project I used Autodesk Fusion 360 and to convert the rendered video into a gif I used https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif/ezgif-7-2f59613cc9d4.mp4

The main components in this project are:
- the bike
- the big wheel
- the small wheels
- the monkey

To see how the mechanism works, I created a motion study named Mechanism Movement.

In this repo I included the following types of files: .f3d (the project itself), .stl (one for each body in the project), .gif (rendered motion study), .png (canvases, a screnshot from fusion, rendered photo).
